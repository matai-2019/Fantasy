This app provides a chat platform to allow communication between the Dungeon Master (DM) and players 
during a session of Dungeons & Dragons(D&D) play.

At present, there is no chat functionality offered in the game itself, and communication tends to be 
through other communication apps such as Skype or face to face between players.

This app allows the DM to message individual or groups of players directly, and for the players to 
message each other. It is not intended for these "chats" to be kept or stored once the game session ends.

This app is intended for a maximum of 6 players pre-group.

The DM will have the capability of inviting players to the chatroom, as well as removing players from the
chatroom.

When a player "dies" in game, they leave the game and so leave the chatroom.

At the end of game play, the database will be reset and all chats will be wiped ready for the next session.
